Sample testing for xarray objects. Currently includes the following statistical tests (most are currently simple, often vectorized, wrappers of [`scipy.stats`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html) functions):
- `xsampletests.ks_2samp_1d`: one-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on two independent samples
- `xsampletests.ks_2samp_2d`: two-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on two independent samples
- `xsampletests.anderson_ksamp`: Anderson-Darling test on K independent samples
- `xsampletests.ttest_ind` : t-test for the means of two independent samples
- `xsampletests.ttest_rel` : t-test for the means of two related samples
- `xsampletests.cramervonmises_2samp` : Cram√©r-von Mises test on two independent samples
- `xsampletests.epps_singleton_2samp` : Epps-Singleton test on two independent samples
- `xsampletests.mannwhitneyu` : Mann-Whitney U rank test on two independent samples
- `xsampletests.ranksums` : Wilcoxon rank-sum statistic on two independent samples
- `xsampletests.kruskal` : Kruskal-Wallis H-test on K independent samples

This package was originally called `xks` but was renamed when tests additional to the KS test were added.
